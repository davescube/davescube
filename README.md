## Disclaimer

The configuration files provided in this repository are for informational and educational purposes only. They are intended to serve as a starting point for understanding security best practices and digital forensics techniques. 

**Important:**

* **Not Production-Ready:** These configurations are NOT guaranteed to be suitable for deployment in a production environment. Every environment has unique security needs and threats. You must thoroughly assess and adapt these configurations to your specific context before implementation.
* **Use at Your Own Risk:**  Dave's Cube will not responsible for any damages, losses, or security vulnerabilities that may arise from using these configurations in any way. It is your responsibility to test and validate the configurations before integration into your environment.

**Recommendations:**

* **Consult a Security Professional:** For production environments, it's highly recommended to consult with a qualified security professional to tailor configurations to your specific security posture and compliance requirements.
* **Stay Updated:** Cybersecurity threats and best practices are constantly evolving. Regularly review and update your configurations to maintain a strong security posture.
